*TASK_1*: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION USING DECISION TREE CLASSIFICATION

*✅ Project Description*

This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the famous Kaggle Titanic Dataset. The goal is to analyze passenger data—such as class, gender, age, and fare—and determine the factors influencing survival.

A Decision Tree Classifier is implemented to train the model, visualize decision rules, and evaluate prediction performance. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, accuracy evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree.

*Key steps include:*

   *1.* Loading and cleaning the Titanic dataset

   *2.* Handling missing values (e.g., imputing missing ages)

   *3.* Encoding categorical variables such as “Sex” using Label Encoding

   *4.* Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

   *5.* Building a Decision Tree Classifier with controlled max-depth and leaf size

   *6.* Visualizing the decision-making process using plot_tree and Graphviz

   *7.* Generating readable if-else rules for interpretation

   *8.* Making a sample prediction based on passenger details

This project helps understand how decision trees work, how features affect survival, and how to interpret model outputs. It serves as a foundational machine learning classification example suitable for beginners and intermediate learners.
